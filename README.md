# BRIDGES-AVATAR data catalog webpage

This repository is the source code for the [BRIDGES-PC3-AVATAR catalog webpage](https://bridges-avatar.github.io/pc3-catalog-webpage/). 
The website's architecture follows a basic, easy-to-read outline (simulation data / toolboxes & software / observations, topped by a short overview), this in order to be as efficient as possible, and for a better outreach to the BRIDGES community.
