## Context elements : the BRIDGES Priority Research Program

BRIDGES-AVATAR is part of a vast interdisciplinary research program, called BRIDGES. This initiative is mainly funded by the [France 2030 investment plan](https://www.info.gouv.fr/grand-dossier/france-2030). In a few words, it aims to study the interactions between human fishing activities and local ecosystems in the South Western Indian Ocean (SWIO). The project's strategy is to follow a global social-ecological approach (using 2 types of social-ecological systems), and to work in concert with researchers, decision makers and stakeholders for the best possible environmental justice. In terms of organization, it consists in six Targeted Projects (TP) - or *Projets ciblés (PC)* in french. It also has 2 structuring components, named GOVERNANCE and TRANSVERSE.
More information about the BRIDGES program is available on [its webpage](https://www.bridges-wio.com/).

## What is going on in the PC3-AVATAR

BRIDGES's third PC, called AVATAR, focuses on setting up the foundations of a digital twin (or avatar) of the ocean, by developing and / or improving ocean models and other numerical tools. This avatar is intended to simulate system trajectories following different social-economical contexts, but also spatial management procedures. Eventually, these outcomes are to be used as a support to help informed decision making.
More information on PC3-AVATAR (including a video description by head of the project Pierre Brasseur) is also available [on this webpage](https://www.bridges-wio.com/projet/tp-3-avatar/).

## What is available here

In order to facilitate exchange on technical developments and / or scientific knowledge, some [tools](https://github.com/BRIDGES-AVATAR/pc3-catalog/blob/main/README.md#PC3-tools), but also [simulations](https://github.com/BRIDGES-AVATAR/pc3-catalog/blob/main/README.md#PC3-simulations) and [observation data](https://github.com/BRIDGES-AVATAR/pc3-catalog/blob/main/README.md#PC3-observations) that have been used and / or produced within the project are listed and detailed [on the project's data catalog](https://github.com/BRIDGES-AVATAR/pc3-catalog/). It aims at sharing the most useful data and other pieces of information between the project members.
