# Global fish biomass density under two different climate change scenarios for epipelagic, migratory and resident communities and 100 sizes ranging from 0.12cm to 1.96m


## People in charge and affiliation

Nicolas Barrier, MARBEC / IRD


## Description

*(Adapted from SEANOE :)* Ensemble simulations of the ecosystem model [APECOSM](https://apecosm.org) forced by the IPSL-CM6-LR climate model with two different Shared Social and economical Pathway scenarios (SSPs) used by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): **SSP1-2.6** (low / very low carbon emissions, reducted anthropic footprint), and **SSP5-8.5** (high / very high carbon emissions, enhanced anthropic footprint).
The output files contain yearly mean biomass density for 3 communities (epipelagic, mesopelagic migratory and mesopelagic redidents) and 100 size classes (ranging from 0.12cm to 1.96m)
The model grid file is also provided. Units are in J/m2 and can be converted in kg/m2 by dividing by 4e6.
These outputs are associated with the "Assessing the time of emergence of marine ecosystems from global to local scales using IPSL-CM6A-LR/APECOSM climate-to-fish ensemble simulations" paper from the Earth's Future "Past and Future of Marine Ecosystems" Special Collection.


## Number of simulations (+ number of members if ensemble)

Ensemble simulation, 6 members


## Calculation cost, volume, access

A total of 6 output files (members 1,2,3,4,6,14), along with their associated grid file, are directly available on SEANOE :

+ For the [SSP1-2.6 climate scenario](https://doi.org/10.17882/102964),
+ For the [SSP5-8.5 climate scenario](https://doi.org/10.17882/102964).

These projections were computed using 6 historical runs (one per member), all directly available on ZENODO :

+ [Member r1](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14045797),
+ [Member r2](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14046098),
+ [Member r3](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14046127),
+ [Member r4](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14046499),
+ [Member r6](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14046489),
+ [Member r14](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14047714).
