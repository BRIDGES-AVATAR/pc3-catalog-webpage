### Scientific context and background

The SWAG configuration series represents an ocean modeling system for studying regional dynamics in the southwest Indian Ocean. These simulations aim to extend previous work by exploiting the latest advances in data (GEBCO2020, ERA5, GLORYS12) and recent developments in the CROCO model. The objective is to perform high-resolution ocean simulations over a relatively long period (1993-2018), covering the western part of the subtropical gyre of the southwest Indian Ocean and the eastern part of the subtropical gyre of the South Atlantic. These configurations avoid constraints related to sea ice and equatorial dynamics, while including key areas such as Madagascar, the Mozambique Channel, the Agulhas Current, and the Benguela Current. They focus specifically on the interactions between the Mozambique Channel and the Agulhas Current, a region where the mechanisms of energy transfer between eddies and mean currents remain poorly understood.

SWAG simulations use GLORYS ocean reanalysis at a 1/12° resolution (daily frequency) to constrain the open boundaries of the domain, as well as ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis (hourly frequency) to force a bulk parameterization at the surface. The daily flows of the 56 main rivers in the region, over the period 1993-2020, are taken from the GLOFASv3.1 product. The SWAG4 1/4° and SWAG12 1/12° versions serve as lower-resolution test beds for calibration and sensitivity analyses. The SWAG36 configuration, with a horizontal resolution of 1/36° (2.7 km), includes 2560 x 1680 x 75 grid points. The SWAG36 simulation covered the period 1993-2018 (including 3 years of spin-up) at a total cost of 1,220,000 CPU hours. Each year of SWAG36 simulation, sampled daily, generates 3 TB of data, reaching a total of 100 TB. The SWAG configurations were compared with observations for the representation of the average ocean structure and eddy activity.

The SWAG36 outputs are stored on the Jean-Zay cluster with a volume of 100 TB. They can be used as boundary conditions for coastal configurations to study the Benguela Current, the Agulhas Current, or the Mozambique Channel.
