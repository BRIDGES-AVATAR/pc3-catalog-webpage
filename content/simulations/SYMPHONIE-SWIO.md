# Model code and regional configuration for 'Modeling Indian Ocean circulation to study marine debris dispersion: insights into high-resolution and Stokes drift effects'


## People in charge and affiliation

Lisa Weiss, LEGOS / IRD 


## Description 

*(Adapted from figshare:) This repository includes the codes of the Symphonie ocean model (version 3.6.6) and the Indian Ocean configurations, together with both model grids, the first corresponding to the HR telescopic grid (from 2 km in coastal zones) and the second to the 1/12° grid (created for comparisons of resolution effects).
