# ICHTHYOP: A Lagrangian tool for modelling ichthyoplankton dynamics


## About Ichthyop  *(adapted from the Ichthyop website)*

Ichthyop is a free Java tool designed to study the effects of physical and biological factors on ichthyoplankton dynamics.

It incorporates the most important processes involved in fish early life: spawning, movement, growth, mortality and recruitment. The tool uses as input time series of velocity, temperature and salinity fields archived from ROMS, MARS, NEMO or SYMPHONIE oceanic models (either files or OpenDAP).


## Where to start ?

+ Ichthyop sources are available on [a dedicated zenodo page](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4243813) (latest and older versions).
+ Documentation, related bibliography and installation instructions are available on [a dedicated website](https://ichthyop.org/).
