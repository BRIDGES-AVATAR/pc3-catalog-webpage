Welcome to the BRIDGES-AVATAR project's data catalog, aiming to set up the foundations of a digital twin (or avatar) of the ocean. This digital twin will eventually be used in several social-ecological modelling systems, for fair, sustainable fishing activities in the South Western Indian Ocean (SWIO). Here you will find some useful data produced and/or used within the project that are already available, however this is not intended to be an exhaustive list. The main objective of this effort is to raise knowledge on the project's motivation and outcome, by providing information that complies with open science and F.A.I.R. data principles - therefore sharing reroductible results.
